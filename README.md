## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/Sass
- CSS grid
- Flexbox
- Animations

### What I learned

This was a somewhat interesting challenge, which gave me the opportunity to really practice CSS grid (particularly the `grid-template-areas` property) in the context of media queries. I also started looking into animations a bit.

### Continued development

I would like to expand the use and complexity of animations in the future projects as it seems like a pretty useful and flexible tool.

### Useful resources

In this project, I decided to dig a bit deeper into the issue of centering content using the grid, and [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwoDkn7AIc&ab_channel=KevinPowell) in particular helped me fugure out the difference between `place-items` and `place-content`.
